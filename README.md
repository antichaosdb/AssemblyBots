# AssemblyBots

This mod is for those looking for a new layout challenge, without having to learn loads of new recipes.  It also does some things with technology that I hope are rather innovative.  Plus, surprises!

It makes every (non-smelting) recipe require an assembly bot.  This depletes the bot, which then has to be recharged.  Assemblybots cannot be crafted directly, but with every craft they have a chance to replicate.  More bots is better, right?  Assemblers all have an extra input slot to accommodate the new recipes.

There are technology options which control how the bots are used and how they are recharged.  These technologies are mutually exclusive.  When you research one, the others are replaced with more expensive versions.  So you can switch between them, but the costs increase, and there is a limit to the number of times you can switch.  Also, these technologies change every recipe and automatically update the recipe in every assembling machine.

To succeed at this you'll have to learn to love filter inserters.  I know setting filters is a pain, so you can hover over a filter inserter and press B to cycle bot filter settings.

SPOILERS!

There are features of this mod that are more "fun" if you don't know about them in advance, so please use spoiler tags.  

Known Issues
------------
- This won't work with large, recipe changing mods like Bobs or Angels.  It could probably be made to, but that's a whole extra level of crazy.  If there are things that break with non-game changing mods, let me know.  DON'T use an auto-research mod with this.
- My homemade tech icons are particularly rubbish.  Any assistance would be appreciated.
- It's meant to be awkward, but the balance may be way off.  config.lua has a load of values that control various balance factors.  Most of these require starting a new map.  
- Part of the "fun" of this mod is trying find ways around the problems it introduces.  Some of the allowed workarounds are intentional, others are things I can't control yet, but should be able to in .15
